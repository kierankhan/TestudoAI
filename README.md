# What it does
TestudoAI is an AutoGPT App where users can ask questions about University of Maryland Courses (course descriptions, average gpa, section specific information, etc.), 
Professors (average rating on PlanetTerp, reviews, what courses they teach, etc.), grade data for courses and professors, and more! With TestudoAI, users have the 
power of PlanetTerp and Testudo at their fingertips.

# How to use it
If you have a question, just ask. TestudoAI has a familiar ChatGPT-like frontend interface. You'll need to supply your own OpenAI API key first, which you can get from
